# Vehicle Tracking in Challenging Scenarios using YOLOv8

This is a semester-long coursework for the third year of the Bachelor of Software Engineering program at Yoobee Colleges in Auckland, focusing on advanced topics in software development and project management.

This repository contains code for a vehicle tracking system based on the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. The system is designed to work in challenging scenarios, such as low light conditions, occlusions, and fast motion.

## Things to do as on 12, May
1) new data recording and re-testing pretrained YOLOv8 model '&#x2705;'  [update: done on 16/05. Notebook "Custom_video_track_count"] 


2) work on evaluation  metrics (F1-score) and work out what other metrics used for Object Detection evaluation 

3) design the UI using Flask

4) submit a paper

## Things to do as on may,19

1)Improve the confidence score (Calculate average confidence ?)

2)Train a custom YOLOv8 model on one bright video &#x2705;

3)Test a new model on the second bright video &#x2705;

4)Do Cross Validation

5)Retest models again and evaluate metrics to see whether performances are consistant

6)List challenges for example, add very bright sun, small sizes of detected vehicles
